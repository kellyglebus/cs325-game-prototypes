The game has different background, characters, and music. There is also a score keeping aspect to it now so players can try to best their own scores.<br><br>

What is interesting about your game technology?

The coconuts appear at random throughout the screen, a song plays during the game, and there is a score board to keep track of your score. The game also restarts itself when you lose.<br><br>

What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?

I learned how to add music to the game and how to create objects at random throughout the screen. The hardest part was trying to get all the characters to show on the screen correctly and at the correct times.<br><br>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li><br><br>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>
It should be a fun and challening game against yourself to get as many birds on the screen as possible!<br><br>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>
The bird character moves via the arrow keys. The bird can move up, down, left, and right. It can also travel through the bounds of the game to come out the other side. The goal is grab the coconuts on the screen (you must hover directly over the center of the coconut). You die if your chain of birds touches itself. <br><br>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>
As your trail of birds gets larger, it's best to move in large patterns you avoid touching the chain to itself. <br><br>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>
fter flying for days through the desert, Tweety the bird stumbles upon a desert Oasis. As their flock joins them, they search for all the coconuts available in order to quench their thirst and fight their hunger. Unfortunately, each bird of the flock is getting very
testy from hunger and does not want any of the other members of the flock to bother it while they search for food. Be careful to avoid touching other members of the flock!<br><br>


<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>
It is a fun and challenging game for everyone that involves very little gaming knowledge.<br><br>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
It depends on how long you are able to make your chain! But, on average, 5-10 minutes.<br><br>
