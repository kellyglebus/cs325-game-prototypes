<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li><br>
I created the game from scratch! I think the way you uncover the fossils with the brush is original and the brushing sound is as well!

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li><br>
The way that the clicking is accompanied by a brushing sound is interesting. The point was to make it feel like an actual excavation.

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li><br>
I learned how to remove objects by clicking on them and to add sounds to accompany clicks. I also learned how to change the cursor image!

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.

<ul>
  <li> I'm sure there are other games that are like this, but I didn't use tutorial code for this game! </li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li><br>
Click on all the piles of dirt in order to uncover all the fossils hiding underneath.

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li><br>
I used the paleontologist theme!

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>
<ul>
  <li>Input: Mouse</li>
  <li>Randomness: Deterministic</li>
  <li>Genre: Collector</li>
  <li>Play Style: Incremental</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li><br>
The game is testing the click to destroy mechanism that the game usees to get rid of the dirt/sand/gravel covering fossils

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li><br>
Players should have fun uncovering unique prehistoric fossils!

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li><br>
Players should use the mouse to click on the dirt/sand/gravel to undercover fossils!

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li><br>
Starting in one particular corner and moving outward would work well.

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li><br>
You are an new palentologist about to begin your first dig ever! Try to impress your other collegues by digging up as many new fossils as you can!
