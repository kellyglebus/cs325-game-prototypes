<h2>Chasing Stars</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li>
  <p>I added the coins to the game. The player grows (stretches) when you collect coins.
  I also added the fire which shrinks the player down when they touch it.
  The platforms were moved and an extra one was added so that the stars moved around more.</p></b>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>
<p> I added the growing and shrinking of the player to make the game more interesting and a little more challenging.
  When the player is smaller, you can dodge the bombs easier. While you are bigger, you can gather stars quicker. I added the fire
  so that the player can make themselves smaller, but they need to be careful since sitting on the fire too long kills the player.


<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li>
<p> This was my first try using phaser and also my first shot making a game. I thought that I got
    a good feel for how the code and objects work. The hardest part was getting started. I wasn't sure
    how to make a game at all, so I struggled to figure where to start. Once I began with one of the
    tutorials, it was much easier.

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>My game is adapted from: <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1">Starting Phaser Tutorial</a></li>
<li>The template was borrowed from: <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic"> Mnimum Template</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</br>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>
<p>Defeat the king and collect all the stars, dodging obstacles on your way!</p>
</br>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>
<p>I used the stretching theme. The character stretches when he grows or shrinks depending if you jump on coins or on the fire.</p></br>


<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>
<li>Input: Keyboard</li>
<li>Randomness: </li>
<li>Play Styles: Achiever</li>
<li>Genres: Platformer</li>
</br>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>
<p>The initial purpose of the prototype is to gain an understanding of phaser.io and javascript so that more sophisticated games can be created in the future.
  Another mechanic that I worked on was making the game more challening. I added the growing/shrinking of the player so that the bombs can be avoided and something that
  made it more difficult to jump platform to platform.

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>
<p>Players should have fun while also being stymied by the obstacles that are added at each level.</p>
</br>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>
<p>Players are able to move left and right via the left and right keys on the keyboard. Players are able to jump by pressing the up arrow key.
  Players should try to jump to all the platforms in order to collect all the stars. Coins should also be collected. When the player grabs the coins
  the player's character grows in size. Jumping on the fire shrinks the player down by the same magnitude. After collecting all the stars available,
  new stars will fall. Bombs start to be introduced at each new level. Touching the bombs ends the game. There are 5 levels available.

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>
<p>It will be important for players to decide when to use the coins to grow and when to use the fire to shrink. Being a smaller character helps avoid
  the bombs, but being bigger gets the stars quicker.</p></br>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>
<p>In Johnny's world, the landscape is made of platforms to be climbed and stars to collect. The king of the land wants to protect all the stars that fall from the sky and lie on the land near the castle.
  The king's guard throw obstacles at anyone who dares to take the stars away. It's a poorly guarded secret that if you are able to collect all the stars the people will appoint you the new king and take castle
  by force. Help Johnny grab all the stars possible so he can release all the people of the land from their tyranny.

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>
<p>The game's demographic is kids aged 10+ since the added obstacles can become frustrating.

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
<p> 10-15 minutes to play.</p></br>
