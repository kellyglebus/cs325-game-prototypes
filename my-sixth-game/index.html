<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?<br>
The game itself is supposed to be a hybrid between chess and battleship. Originally, the player wouldn't be able to see the oher players board so attacks would be more random like in battleship.
That design didn't work well for the set up of the analog game iteration, so instead, the die creates the randomness and players move according to the die roll.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?<br>
It took me a really long to figure out everything. The hardest part was trying to make the pieces draggable. There were issues with the size of the pieces and where their boundaries ended so you would be moving the wrong piece or too many pieces at the same time.
It also implements a random die roll. It picks a random number between 1 and 6 when the die is clicked. Once clicked, it updates the text on the screen so that you know how many spaces you can move. When you make your move to attack the other side, you are able to 
click the gameboard to add a red square to mark your turn and it doesn't interact with your ability to drag the pieces. I also added a sound effect for the die so that it makes a noise when you roll it.
I'm working for the next iteration to create it so that you are playing against the computer, but that was not feasible for this iteration.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
I did learn how to make pieces draggable and how to update text as the game goes on. The easiest part was setting up the background and the original placess for the pieces. It was hard at first to get the background to the correct size and also hard to format the die correctly.
I struggled a lot trying to make the pieces draggable. Like I said above, there were issues with the piece sizes that I could not see on the screen so the wrong pieces were being dragged every time. It took a long time to figure out why it was doing that. I also struggled with 
updating the next for the die roll. I wasn't sure where to place the die roll function and then place the text update since I wanted them to happen at the same time.

Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
</li>
It closely resembles either battleship or chess/checkers. I wanted the game to be like battleship except you could move your pieces around the board as the game goes on. I'm still trying to 
figure out how to make it so you can play against the computer (or a multiplayer game setup)<br>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>
Play with a friend and try to best them with luck and strategy in Castle Fight

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>
This is evaluating playability digitally. The game works in an analog form and its time to set it up digitally.

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>
They should have fun and competitive when playing each other.

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>
<p>No themes were required. Copies the gameplay of the analog prototype</p></br>


<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>
<li>Input: Mouse</li>
<li>Randomness: Deterministic </li>
<li>Play Styles: Competitor</li>
<li>Genres: fighting</li>
</br>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>
Yellow player moves first and rolls the die. Player then has 3 choices based on the die roll. Player can move their piece (on their side of the red line) the same number of spaces as the die roll. Or they can trace a path to the other side and attack the opponents piece. The player's piece remains on their side, but a red square is place on
the same board where the attack happens. If no opposing pieces are within reach, player can also place a red square on an open space. Spaces cannot be moved to if they are occupied by a red square. You can begin to block in the opposing player with this strategy. After one of the three moves is taken, the turn alternates to the other player 
and the same game play occurs. This alternation occurs until all one sides pieces are covered by a red square.

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>
If you are unable to attack pieces, use the ability to put down red squares to block your opposing player in.

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>
Guard your side of the battlefield! You are under attack from an opposing kingdom and must protect your troops on the battlefield. Be strategic in your attack moves and successfully vanquish the opposing army!

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>
Player 10+ since the game rules can be confusing to understand.

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
5-10 minutes
